# simple-cpp-engine

This is a a simple game engine written in c++, just to test my knowledge and skills.

## Input System
Wrapper static class for GLFW input polling. At the moment supports Keyboard, Gamepad and mouse input.

## 2D Rendering
It currently features a basic 2D renderer with sprite batching support.

## BitmapFont Rendering
There is very limited support for font rendering. BitmapFont rendering only works if the given texture characters are aligned with the ASCII codes (see example font included).
